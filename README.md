# AdmissionPedia-Laravel
One of the most complex web projects I have ever done in my undergrad. This project is intended for the admission examinee students of Bangladesh.
They can easily find out suitable universities based on their GPA. Also they can create a great community by creating post, replying and many more.

To run or deploy this project please read the Instruction.txt file very carefully.
